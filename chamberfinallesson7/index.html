                <p>Draper features the most trails and largest open space out of any city along the Wasatch Front with 117 miles of scenic trails and 5,000 acres of open space. Draper is nestled in the corners of Salt Lake County and Utah County with trails crossing the valley, and weaving through Corner Canyon and the surrounding mountain ridges.</p>

            <p>he Bear Canyon Suspension Bridge is located on the east side of Draper in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountain Range. It is typically accessed from the Orson Smith Trailhead. The bridge spans 185 feet across Bear Canyon and connects the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. The bridge was designed and constructed by Ralph L. Wadsworth Construction Co. Inc. and paid for by donations from residents and friends of Draper City</p>

            <p>Little Valley could be the world's greatest beginner trail system. The A line and B line are the only downhill bike-only trails. The A trail is a beginner trail with easy rollers and bermed turns. The B trail is a little more advanced. The C and D line are multi-use and multi-directional. Each trail is only about ¼ mile in length and all end at the parking lot. It's tight and compact, so beginners won't get overwhelmed or lost. The climbs are gentle, so they won't get worn out.</p>
